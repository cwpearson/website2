I'm helping teach the Programming and tUning Massively Parallel Systems ([PUMPS](pumps)) hosted by the Barcelona Supercomputing Center at UPC Barcelona, Spain!

<!--more-->

The school teaches GPU programming and algorithm techniques to about 80 students from around the world.

![wmh][wmh] Professor Wen-mei Hwu lecturing on binning techniques.

I'm helping as a lab TA, and also working with some advanced students on using CUDA and NVIDIA GPUs to accelerate their research applications.
