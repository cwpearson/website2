I have received the [Ernest A. Reid Fellowship in Electrical Engineering](https://ece.illinois.edu/academics/grad/fellowships/reid) for the 2019-2020 academic year!

    This fellowship is given to a student or students with exceptional promise for an academic career; particularly demonstrating interest in and capability for the instructional program.  The objective of the fellowship is to encourage students to consider an academic career.

My gratitude to the selection committee, and to Mrs. Nell W. Reid for establishing the fellowship in honor of her husband.
