Sandia National Laboratories (my employer) has [announced a partnership with NextSilicon](https://www.sandia.gov/research/2023/11/09/sandia-partners-with-nextsilicon-and-penguin-solutions-to-deliver-first-of-its-kind-runtime-reconfigurable-accelerator-technology/) ([archive link](https://web.archive.org/web/20231109165912/https://www.sandia.gov/research/2023/11/09/sandia-partners-with-nextsilicon-and-penguin-solutions-to-deliver-first-of-its-kind-runtime-reconfigurable-accelerator-technology/))

I can finally say I've been spending a decent chunk of my time at work on this effort!
