A few times per year I make the mistake of believing that Amazon is the most convenient way of purchasing something that I want.
This time, I needed some new rollers for my Roomba j7+, and I went on Amazon and clicked the first thing.
That was a third-party replacement, rather than the geniune parts.

The parts I received were slightly too large to fit in the Roomba well, so I left a negative review, and Amazon showed me this:

Turns out I didn't need to make 6 reviews to get a joke at all!

I'm now waiting on receiving replacement parts from the iRobot store.
