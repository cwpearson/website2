I've created a fork of the [mantevo/miniAero](https://github.com/mantevo/miniAero) proxy application, featuring support for Kokkos 4, the CMake build system, and Python 3.
You can explore the fork on [github](https://github.com/cwpearson/miniAero).

miniAero is part of the [mantevo](manetvo.org) suite of proxy applications, which simplify the core computational components of larger high-performance computing applications into more manageable, smaller packages.
MiniAero is a computation fluid dynamics (CFD) code.
It utilizes a cell-centered unstructured finite volume solver that can operate with either first-order or second-order accuracy, alongside explicit time integration via a standard fourth-order Runge Kutta method.
MiniAero is structured to support simulations based on either the Euler or compressible Navier-Stokes equations, making it versatile for studying transonic turbulent flows among other scenarios.

MiniAero was released in 2016 and enough has changed in the HPC software community to make it a bit annoying to run, even though the underlying computation is still relevant.
This fork is intended to be easier to use in 2024.

miniAero is implemented using the [Kokkos](kokkos.org) performance portability library.
Kokkos has had several major releases since miniAero was written, and although the basic features that miniAero uses haven't changed much, the API has drifted slightly.
I made minor modifications to allow miniAero to be compiled with Kokkos 4.3.00.

Kokkos has also settled on CMake as a build system.
Back in 2016, this was not as well established, and miniAero used Make.
The miniAero fork supports CMake (as well as CTest for testing).

On the subject of testing, the original test scripts were written with Python 2.
Python 2 is pretty much gone now, so I updated them to use Python 3.
I also added CI tests with Github Actions to hopefully prevent introducing any future regressions.

*Although miniAero was originally developed by researchers at my employer, Sandia National Labs, I have not consulted with them on this fork. The original project seems to be inactive.*
