This past week I travelled to the Array Operations Center for the NRAO in Socorro, New Mexico, to help give a [Kokkos](kokkos.org) tutorial and hackathon to several teams there.
They were kind enough to take me on a tour of the [Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very_Large_Array), which is about an hour to the west out in the middle of nowhere.
The site was shut down for routine maintenance, so we were able to have my cell phone on and take some pictures.
We also got to climb up into one of the 25-meter dishes!

Since the array was off for maintenance, all the dishes were aimed (nearly) straight up at the sky, in their "stow" or idle positions.
