I'm not much of a Twitter afficionado, which is probably why I prefer to use the following search string:

```
filter:follows -filter:replies -filter:"RT @" 
```

This shows only people you follow, no replies, and no retweets from people you follow.

[Here](https://twitter.com/search?q=filter%3Afollows%20-filter%3Areplies%20-filter%3A%22RT%20%40%22) is a direct link to Twitter with that search query.
