The Summit supercomputer at Oak Ridge National Laboratory was decomissioned on Friday, November 15, 2024.
I was at Oak Ridge the preceeding week for a Kokkos developer meeting, and my host took us to see it!
There were a handful of signatures on the side of one of the cabinets:

* Daniel Hoag: Federal Project Director for the DOE Office of Science.
* Jen-Hsun Huang: Founder, President, and CEO of Nvidia, which provided the V100 GPUs in the computer.
* Rick Perry: US secretary of energy while Summit was being comissioned.
* Ginni Rometty: Chairman, President, and CEO of IBM, which developed the computer and provided the POWER9 CPUs.
* Thomas Zacharia: ORNL lab director.

Summit was a primary vehicle for my Ph.D work and it was amazing to see it before it's gone forever.
