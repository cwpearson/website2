## Academia

- 2018 Spring University of Illinois Project TA for ECE408/CS483
- 2017 Fall University of Illinois Head TA for ECE408/CS483
- 2017-2018 University of Illinois [Mavis Future Faculty Fellow](http://publish.illinois.edu/engr-mavis/2017-2018-mavis-fellows/).
- 2015 Fall University of Illinois TA for ECE408

I have been a teaching assistant for the following courses:

- ECE408/CS483: Heterogeneous Parallel Programming at the University of Illinois
- E155: Microprocesser-based Systems: Design & Applications at Harvey Mudd College 
- E85: Digital Electronics and Computer Architecture at Harvey Mudd College

I have also been a teaching assistant for the Programming and Tuning Massively Parallel Systems
[(PUMPS)](http://bcw.ac.upc.edu/PUMPS2017/) summer school in Barcelona since 2014.

I have also mentored undergraduates and a high school student, who is a co-author on two papers.

During the Mavis fellowship, I administered the ECE 408 GPU programming project in spring 2018. I created

* Four lectures on machine learning ([1][l1], [2][l2], [3][l3], [4][l4])
* A [course project][project_repo] where students add a GPU convolution operator to MXNet.
* Project kickoff [slides][kickoff-slides] ([repo][kickoff-repo]).

I also created a set of resources on using Nvidia's Nsight Compute and Nsight Systems performance profiling tools, including a 75 minute recorded lecture.
