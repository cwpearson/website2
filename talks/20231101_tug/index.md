abstract: "This talk walks through a side-by-side comparison of the Kokkos implementation and traditional implement of the Tpetra finite element assembly example in the Trilinos scientific computing project. It emphasizes five main changes: parallel regions, device allocations, function annotations, atomic operations, and accessing Tpetra data on-device."
