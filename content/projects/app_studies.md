### Tools and Techniques for Code Acceleration

I worked with Abdul Dakkak and Cheng Li at Illinois on a full-stack performance analasis platform for machine learning software. The same infrastructure is also used to deliver some course projects for GPU programming courses.

I worked with Mert Hidayetoglu at Illinois on GPU acceleration of a massively-parallel tomographic image reconstruction code.

I was part of the IME-Accelerators team for the NCSA PAID program. This program pairs domain scientists with computing specialists to improve effective utilization of the Blue Waters supercomputer at the National Petascale Computing Facility. I have worked on:

 - CUDA Kernel Optimization for [AWP](https://scec.usc.edu/scecpedia/AWP-ODC) with the Southern California Earthquake Center 
 - OpenACC Acceleration for [SETSM](https://u.osu.edu/setsm/) with Ohio State University
