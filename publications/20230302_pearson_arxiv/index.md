  Demand for low-latency and high-bandwidth data transfer between GPUs has
driven the development of multi-GPU nodes. Physical constraints on the
manufacture and integration of such systems has yielded heterogeneous
intra-node interconnects, where not all devices are connected equally. The next
generation of supercomputing platforms are expected to feature AMD CPUs and
GPUs. This work characterizes the extent to which interconnect heterogeneity is
visible through GPU programming APIs on a system with four AMD MI250x GPUs, and
provides several insights for users of such systems.
