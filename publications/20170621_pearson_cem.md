We compare multi-GPU performance of the multilevel fast multipole method (MLFMM) on two different systems: A shared-memory IBM S822LC workstation with four NVIDIA P100 GPUs, and 16 XK nodes (each is employed with a single NVIDIA K20X GPU) of the Blue Waters supercomputer. MLFMM is implemented for solving scattering problems involving two-dimensional inhomogeneous bodies. Results show that the multi-GPU implementation provides 794 and 969 times speedups on the IBM and Blue Waters systems over their corresponding sequential CPU executions, respectively, where the sequential execution on the IBM system is 1.17 times faster than on the Blue Waters System.
